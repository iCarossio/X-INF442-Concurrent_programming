# Ã‰cole polytechnique | INF431 - Concurrent programming with Java

Academic year: 2017-2018
Teaching coordinator: [Eric Goubault](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Eric.Goubault/)

> There is no longer **application** that is not intrinsically parallel: from a simple graphical interface up to the robot controller, that manage competing events and programs, running simultaneously, and sharing common resources (memory, but also physical resources, sensors, motors, etc.). 
>
> Similarly, he is no longer **hardware** that is not intrinsically parallel: all modern processors are multicore, and allow, through the multi-threaded programming, to get much better performance in sequential programming.
>
> This course aims to give the tools to master efficiently **concurrent programming**, avoiding the various pitfalls related to the use of shared resources. Students will handle **Java threads**, remote method calls (**Java Remote Method Invocation**, client / server) and the **Mapreduce** model (with **Hadoop**), and will see applications (interfaces graphics, Android, etc.).
